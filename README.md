# Libbitcoin Client

*Bitcoin Client Query Library*

Note that you need g++ 4.8 or higher. For this reason Ubuntu 12.04 and older are not supported. Make sure you have installed [libbitcoin-protocol](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-protocol) beforehand according to its build instructions.

```sh
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
```

libbitcoin-client is now installed in `/usr/local/`.
